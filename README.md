  <h1 style="font-size: 3rem;">🧠 61hrt — The First Transparent AI Interface</h1>
  <p><em>“If LLMs could think out loud... this is what it would look like.”</em></p>
</div>

## 📜 Overview

Most LLMs today are **black boxes** — you ask a question, and they return an answer. No context. No source. No trust.

**61hrt flips that script.**  
It’s a sleek, lightweight, fully transparent AI interface that explains *exactly how* it thinks — step by step.

> Built using Streamlit + Perplexity Sonar API  
> Designed for researchers, students, and builders who want explainability 🔍

## 🔍 Why 61hrt?

> “Can I trust this model?”  
> “Where did it get that info?”  
> “What’s the logic behind this answer?”

61hrt answers all of those. It shows:
- 💡 Reasoning steps  
- 🔗 Source links  
- 📊 Confidence levels  
- ✅ Final Answer (after thinking)

You don’t get a guess — you get a **thought process**.
